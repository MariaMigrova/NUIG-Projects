# NUIG-Projects
Projects from my course HDip in Data Analytics and Visualisation in NUIG, Ireland
Analysing a real-world data provided by Kaptec company from their call center activity. This project
incorporated different techniques like LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to find the most common topics
in the call center activity and to evaluation agents’ performances by comparing their confidence level for
each topic. The next part implemented a Sentiment Analysis to find if the given text is positive or
negative. The last part of our project was predicting sentiment of each topic using Naïve Bayes method
and Decision Trees. This project was completed using R studio. The communication with Kaptec
company was provided on weekly bases using Microsoft Teams software.

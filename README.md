# Kaptec Call Center Analysis
## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Description of Business Problem/Need
In today's data-driven age, companies leverage data as their most powerful asset for competitive advantage. Call centers generate vast amounts of data through customer interactions, offering valuable insights into operations, customer service, and sales. This project focuses on analyzing call center data from Kaptec, a company providing managed IT services and contact center outsourcing. By leveraging data analytics, we aim to improve operational efficiency, agent performance, and customer satisfaction.

### 1.2 Research on Potential Analytics and Visualization Tools Used
For data analysis, we utilized R Studio, a versatile open-source software tailored for data science tasks. Specifically, we implemented Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling to extract themes from call transcripts. Additionally, sentiment analysis was performed to categorize conversation tones as positive or negative. The project also involved comparing agent performance across different conversation topics and predicting sentiment using Naïve Bayes and Decision Trees classification algorithms.

## 2. The Business Problem/Need
### 2.1 Description of Context
Kaptec specializes in customer experience solutions, including contact center outsourcing and managed IT services. Recently, they transitioned their PBX phone functionality to a cloud-based system provided by 8x8, offering advanced features like ACD, IVR, and speech analytics. Despite these capabilities, there's a need to analyze agent conversations to enhance performance and customer satisfaction.

### 2.2 Data Sources
Data was sourced directly from the 8x8 system through APIs, including call recordings, interaction metadata, and historical metrics. This comprehensive dataset provided insights into agent-customer interactions, sentiments, and performance metrics.

### 2.3 Data Preparation
The dataset underwent preprocessing, including cleaning, tokenization, and sentiment analysis. Features such as agent ID, duration, sentiment, and transcription were selected for analysis. Data cleansing ensured accuracy and relevance for subsequent analysis.

### 2.4 Preliminary Analysis
LDA was applied to identify common topics in call transcripts, aiding in understanding customer issues and agent performance. Sentiment analysis categorized conversation tones, while performance metrics were analyzed to assess agent effectiveness across different topics.

## 3. Project Objectives
The main goals of the project included analyzing agent efficiency, identifying common conversation topics, evaluating agent performance, and predicting sentiment. Visualization techniques were employed to present findings effectively.

## 4. The Solution
### 4.1 Refined Project Objectives
Agent performance was evaluated across different conversation topics, with sentiment analysis aiding in understanding customer interactions. Predictive models using Naïve Bayes and Decision Trees were employed to forecast sentiment based on call attributes.

### 4.2 Analysis and Visualization Methods Employed
Various analytical methods, including topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and predictive modeling, were utilized to derive insights from call center data. Visualization techniques such as bar charts, word clouds, and density plots were employed to present findings effectively.

### 4.3 Work Breakdown and Planning
The project was divided into phases focusing on client satisfaction analysis and agent efficiency assessment. Proper planning ensured the timely completion of each phase.

## 5. Evaluation of the Solution
### 5.1 Presentation of the Solution
Findings from the analysis were presented using visualizations and comprehensive summaries, providing actionable insights for Kaptec's call center operations.

## 6. Conclusions
### 6.1 Evaluation of the Project as a Whole
The project provided valuable insights into call center operations, agent performance, and customer interactions. While sentiment analysis and predictive modeling showed promising results, further refinement and data collection may enhance accuracy and applicability.

### 6.2 Lessons Learnt
The project provided valuable learning experiences in data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization. Skills in programming and data analytics were honed, contributing to professional development.

### 6.3 Potential Future Work
Future iterations of the project could focus on expanding the dataset, refining predictive models, and exploring additional variables for analysis to further improve insights and decision-making.
